meshing-with-landlab
====================

"Meshing" (messing) with `Landlab <https://github.com/landlab/landlab>`_ by linking mesh generators from other models.

**To do**:

- Create and demonstrate simple coupling to `dmesh <https://github.com/nschloe/dmsh>`_
- Mesh refinement via `Anuga <https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/anuga_core>`_
- Examples of Landlab functions/components being used with these new meshes
- Interactive in-notebook visualization of meshes with `itkwidgets <https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itkwidgets>`_
- Interactive results viewing via `PyVista <https://github.com/pyvista/pyvista>`_
